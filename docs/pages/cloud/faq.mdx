### Can I use Teleport Cloud in production?

Yes. Large organizations leverage Teleport Cloud to manage the vast number of resources in their organization. Teleport Cloud is audited regularly to ensure the most reliable and secure service possible is available to our customers.

## What is the cloud SLA

Teleport Cloud commits to SLA of (=cloud.sla.monthly_percentage=)% of monthly uptime percentage,
a maximum of (=cloud.sla.monthly_downtime=) of downtime per month.

### How does Cloud Billing work?

[Reach out to sales](https://goteleport.com/signup/enterprise) to discuss pricing.

### Are you using AWS-managed encryption keys, or CMKs via KMS?

We use AWS-managed keys. Currently there is no option to provide your own key.

### Is this Teleport's S3 bucket, or my bucket based on my AWS credentials?

It's a Teleport-managed S3 bucket with AWS-managed keys.
Currently there is no way to provide your own bucket.

## How long will Teleport Cloud retain my data?

See our documentation on [data retention](./architecture.mdx#data-retention).

## How do I add Nodes to Teleport Cloud?

You can connect servers, Kubernetes clusters, databases and applications
using [reverse tunnels](../setup/admin/adding-nodes.mdx).

There is no need to open any ports on your infrastructure for inbound traffic.

## Which Proxy Service ports are open on my Teleport Cloud tenant?

Teleport Cloud allocates a different set of ports to each tenant. To see which
ports are available for your Teleport Cloud tenant, run a command similar to the
following, replacing `mytenant.teleport.sh` with your tenant domain:

```code
$ curl https://mytenant.teleport.sh/webapi/ping | jq '.proxy'
```

The output should resemble the following, including the unique ports assigned to
your tenant:

```json
{
  "kube": {
    "enabled": true,
    "public_addr": "mytenant.teleport.sh:11107",
    "listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3026"
  },
  "ssh": {
    "listen_addr": "[::]:3023",
    "tunnel_listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3024",
    "public_addr": "mytenant.teleport.sh:443",
    "ssh_public_addr": "mytenant.teleport.sh:11105",
    "ssh_tunnel_public_addr": "mytenant.teleport.sh:11106"
  },
  "db": {
    "postgres_public_addr": "mytenant.teleport.sh:11109",
    "mysql_listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3036",
    "mysql_public_addr": "mytenant.teleport.sh:11108"
  },
  "tls_routing_enabled": true
}
```

This output also indicates whether TLS routing is enabled for your tenant. When
TLS routing is enabled, connections to a Teleport service (e.g., the Teleport
SSH Service) are routed through the Proxy Service's public web address, rather
than through a port allocated to that service.

In this case, you can see that TLS routing is enabled, and that the Proxy
Service's public web address (`ssh.public_addr`) is `mytenant.teleport.sh:443`.

Read more in our [TLS Routing](../architecture/tls-routing.mdx) guide.

## How can I access the tctl admin tool?

We have made changes to allow you to log into your cluster using `tsh`, then use `tctl` remotely:

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=myinstance.teleport.sh
$ tctl status
```

You must use the enterprise version of `tctl`.

### Why am I getting `permission denied` errors when using `tctl`?

If you have a local file `/etc/teleport.yaml` on your machine `tctl` will attempt to use the local cluster. Set the environment variable `TELEPORT_CONFIG_FILE` to `""` so it will not attempt to use that Teleport configuration file.

```code
$ export TELEPORT_CONFIG_FILE=""
$ tctl tokens add --type=node
```

### Are dynamic node tokens available?

After [connecting](#how-can-i-access-the-tctl-admin-tool) `tctl` to Teleport Cloud, users can generate
[dynamic tokens](../setup/admin/adding-nodes.mdx):

```code
$ tctl nodes add --ttl=5m --roles=node,proxy --token=$(uuid)
```

### When will a security audit be available?

Security audit has been completed and is available [here](https://goteleport.com/resources/audits/teleport-cloud-security-audit-2021/).

### What does Teleport Cloud run in?

Teleport Cloud is deployed using a [Gravity](https://github.com/gravitational/gravity)
cluster on AWS.

### Will Teleport be automatically upgraded with each release?

We will be upgrading the preview version of Teleport Cloud automatically.

### Does your SOCII report include Teleport Cloud?

(!docs/pages/includes/soc2.mdx!)

### Can a customer deploy multiple clusters in Teleport Cloud?

Not at this time.

### Is FIPS mode an option?

FIPS is not currently an option for Teleport Cloud clusters.

### How do you store passwords?

Password hashes are generated using
[Golang's bcrypt](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt).

### How does Teleport manage web certificates? Can I upload my own?

Teleport uses [letsencrypt.org](https://letsencrypt.org/) to issue
certificates for every customer. It is not possible to upload a custom
certificate or use a custom domain name.

### Do you encrypt data at rest?

Each deployment is using at-rest encryption using AWS DynamoDB and S3 at-rest encryption
for customer data including session recordings and user records.
